Summary

This project examines the relationship between NBA player salaries and their on-court performance during the 2022–2023 NBA season. We integrate two independently authored datasets from Kaggle—one containing player performance statistics and another containing player salaries across multiple seasons. We focus our analysis on:

Whether salary aligns with performance

Identifying overvalued and undervalued players

Creating performance-efficiency metrics (e.g., salary per point, PER-like values, per-minute value)

Understanding the variability in player compensation relative to statistical output

The project implements a complete end-to-end workflow following the IS477 data lifecycle:

Data discovery and acquisition

Ethical/legal review

Storage and organization (DuckDB)

Extraction & enrichment

Data integration

Quality assessment

Data cleaning

Reproducibility & workflow automation

Metadata and documentation

The final cleaned dataset, workflow scripts, and analysis results are included and fully reproducible end-to-end.
